                    <p>
                        Linkster is a Link bank where you can keep all links that matters to you and your business. With Linkster,
                        your audience can easily search through your links and click the one that matters to them. You get statistic
                        of each link you created.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Linkster gives you a single link eg: <span class="text-primary">www.mylinks.com.ng/username</span>  which you can customise  to suit your brand 
                        colors and taste. This link serves as your personal profile page that houses all your links.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have lots of improvements coming to linkster over the next few months, including customised templates which will allow you to select 
                        premium pre designed template for your home page. This means at the click of a button, your profile page also called home page will have that 
                        professional outlook even if you are not good with colors. We will also add to list of analytics for each link that you add to your profile page
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our basic plan is free, and our basic plan is generous enough without restriction on number of links. We however have premium
                        service (at a token), for people who want beyond a simple profile page. Our basic plan will continue to be free.
                    </p>
